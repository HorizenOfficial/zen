What is Horizen?
----------------
Horizen is an inclusive and scalable platform where everyone is empowered and rewarded for their contributions. Horizen’s sidechain platform enables real-world applications mapped onto a public blockchain architecture with the largest node network in the industry. Horizen’s Sidechain-SDK provides developers with all necessary components to deploy their own fully customizable blockchains on Horizen’s open sidechain protocol, Zendoo.

Zend_oo - the Zendoo-powered Sidechain Platform
----------------
Zend_oo is the new version of zend allowing the Horizen mainchain to manage and interact with any number of sidechains. 
This version of zend implements the Zendoo verifiable Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) that allows the creation of ad-hoc sidechains with independently customizable business logic. Additionally, it enables the transfer of coins from the mainchain to sidechains and from sidechains back to the mainchain through SNARK verifiable withdrawal certificates.

Horizen Sidechains are fully scalable and decentralized:
----------------
- The Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) enables coin transferring between sidechains and the mainchain without the need for the mainchain to follow them and to know their internal structure. The coin transfers from sidechains to the mainchain are performed using cryptographically authenticated certificates received from the sidechains.
- Certificate authentication and validation are achieved through the innovative use of SNARK technology, which enables constant-sized proofs of arbitrary computations, without involving a trusted third party and keeps the mainchain totally agnostic from any sidechain rules.

The main feature of our construction is the high degree of generalization. Sidechains are allowed to use their own rules and data, defining custom SNARKs to let the mainchain authenticate their certificates without any knowledge of the sidechain internals.

You can read more about the Zendoo protocol in our [whitepaper](https://www.horizen.io/assets/files/Horizen-Sidechain-Zendoo-A_zk-SNARK-Verifiable-Cross-Chain-Transfer-Protocol.pdf), and explore our default sidechain implementation and SDK in our [Sidechains-SDK](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sidechains-SDK).

New features
----------------
- Sidechain declaration with customizable SNARK verification key
- Forward transfers from mainchain to sidechain
- Sidechain backward transfers from sidechain to mainchain by means of withdrawal certificates
- Sidechain epoch management with liveness monitoring and ceasing procedure
- Mainchain backward transfer request from sidechain to mainchain
- Ceased sidechain withdrawals
- Agnostic withdrawal certificate validation via custom SNARK proof verification (powered by [ginger-lib](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ginger-lib))
- Extended RPC interface to create and dispatch sidechain declaration, forward transfer transactions, mainchain backward transfer requests, ceased sidechain withdrawal requests and withdrawal certificates.
- Extensive unit tests and integration tests for verifying sidechain functionality
