This archive contains the coverage report files for zend
branch ap/clangtidy_integr - commit d89af61ae5d8750ea0539f5ed9bf95f0af44805d

The included files are:
- total_coverage.info
- py_test_coverage_0.info 
- sample_coverage_script.sh
- merged_coverage.info
- Code_coverage_dependency_final.drawio.png
All the intermediate .info files are not being included. I can provide them, if relevent for the investigation.
All the files have been produced locally (not through Travis CI) for excluding non-relevant variables.

total_coverage.info and py_test_coverage_0.info are those submitted to the Codacy app through the
API; these files produced the outcome of the actual analysis currenty visible on the dashboard.

The provided Bash script includes a simplified flow of operations used for producing all the
included files. I left only the relevant commands for the analysis.
