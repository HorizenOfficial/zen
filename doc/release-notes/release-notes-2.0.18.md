      updated developer notes with new requirements
      moved sic-specific utiltls files to sic folder and namespace
      [WIP] implemented new core classes for fork management with new unit tests [WIP] Modified makefiles to have a separate libsicash [WIP] Removed Sicash-specific chain params: hfFixReplayProtectionHeight, hfFixPS3SHHeight, sfReplayProtectionHeight, hfCommunityFundHeight, nChainsplitIndex, nChainsplitTime and fDisableCoinbaseProtectionForCommunityFund(always true - unused). [WIP] increased fork index by 1 for original chainsplitfork and sfReplayProtection. These forks were non-inclusive (the starting block of the fork was previously not included in the fork) as opposed to newer forks that are inclusive. [WIP] refactor pass to force all calls through ForkManager directly.
