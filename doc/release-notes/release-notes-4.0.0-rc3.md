zend v4.0.0-RC3
=========

As the previous version of `zend` (3.3.1), this RC3 is expected to deprecate at block **#1359120**, which will occur on **May 31st, 2023 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC**. Please, update to `v4.0.0` before May 31st (the final release will be available soon).

A **hard fork** has activated on testnet at block **#1228700**, which has occurred on **March 13th at 14:37:43 GMT+0000**.

Starting from `v4.0.0`, `zend` binaries for Linux will be released in **only one version**, which includes the `AddressIndexing` features that were previously only available in the `bitcore` version. This means that we will not publish specific `bitcore` versions.
